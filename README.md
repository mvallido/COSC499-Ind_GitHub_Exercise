# COSC499-Ind_GitHub_Exercise

This program takes a 2D binary grid where 1's represent land and 0's represent water. The program will calculate the number of total islands there are in the grid, as well as the largest island (largest area). An island is surrounded by water and can only be formed by connecting the adjacent 1's horizontally or vertically. Anything outside of the grid can be assumed as water.

Example Grid:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0],
 [0,0,0,1]]

 This grid has two islands and the largest island has an area of one.

 To run the program, ensure python is downloaded and clone or download the number-of-islands file. Then run the following command:
 ```
/user/directory/ % python number-of-islands.py
 ```
